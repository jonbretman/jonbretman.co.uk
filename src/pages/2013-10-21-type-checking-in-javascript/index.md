This post was originally posted on the [Badoo Tech Blog](http://techblog.badoo.com/blog/2013/11/01/type-checking-in-javascript)

Here at Badoo we write a lot of JavaScript, our mobile web app contains about 60,000 lines of the stuff, and maintaining that much code can be challenging. One of the trickier aspects of working with a client side JavaScript application of this scale is avoiding exceptions. In this post I want to discuss a particular type of exception that you have probably seen a few times - a [TypeError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError).

As the MDN link above explains:

> "A TypeError is thrown when an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function" - MDN

So to avoid TypeError's we need to be checking that the values we pass into functions are correct, and that any code we write checks the validity of an operand before using an operator on it. For example the `.` operator is not compatible with `null` or `undefined` and the `instanceof` operator is not compatible with anything that isn't a function. Using these operators on an operand that is not compatible with it will throw a TypeError. If you are coming from a statically typed language like Java where you normally don't need to worry about things like this then this may seem totally horrible, in which case you might want to consider using a "compile to JavaScript" language that has static typing, for example [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) or [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). If however you quite like writing JavaScript, or already have a large JavaScript code base, all is not lost as performing this type checking does not need to be painful, and can also have a pleasant side effect of helping others to understand you code.

Lets start by looking a fairly straight forward example of getting some data from the server, performing some operations on that data, and then using it to render some HTML.

```js
Api.get('/conversations', function (conversations) {

    var intros = conversations.map(function (c) {
        var name = c.theirName;
        var mostRecent = c.messages[0].text.substring(0, 30);
        return name + ': ' + mostRecent;
    });

    App.renderMessages(intros);

});
```

The first thing to note is that from looking at this code we don't actually know what `conversations` is supposed to be. We could assume that since it's obviously expected to have a `map` function that it should be an array, but assumptions are bad and in reality it could be anything that implements a `map` method. The function passed to `map` makes a lot of assumptions about the `c` variable. If any of those assumptions are wrong then a TypeError will be thrown and `renderMessages()` will never be called.

So how we can go about checking the validity of types in this example? Well first let's look at the different methods of checking for types in JavaScript.

### typeof
The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, but the types it returns are very limited. For example the following all return **"object"**

```js
typeof {};
typeof [];
typeof null;
typeof document.createElement('div');
typeof /abcd/;
```

### instanceof
The `instanceof` operator is used to determine if an object's prototype chain contains the prototype property of a given constructor.

```js
[] instanceof Array; // true

var Foo = function () {};
new Foo() instanceof Foo; // true
```

Although this will work, using `instanceof` for checking the type of a native object is not a great idea as it does not work for primitives values.

```js
'a' instanceof String; // false
5 instanceof Number; // false
true instanceof Boolean; //false
```

### Object.prototype.toString
The `toString` method on `Object.prototype` is used by many JavaScript frameworks to infer type and this is basically because the spec for this method is very clear and has been implemented consistently across all browsers. Point **15.2.4.2** of the [ECMA-262](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf) spec says:

* If the this value is undefined return `"[object Undefined]"`.
* If the `this` value is null, return `"[object Null]"`.
* Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value as the argument.
* Let class be the value of the \[\[Class\]\] internal property of O.
* Return the String value that is the result of concatenating the three Strings `"[object "`, class, and `"]"`.

So basically this method will always return a String in the form "\[object Foo\]" where **Foo** is going to be **"Null"**, **"Undefined"**, or the internal Class used to create `this`. By using the `call` method to change the `this` value and a simple regular expression to parse the result we can get a string representing the type of anything.

```js
var type = function (o) {
    var s = Object.prototype.toString.call(o);
    return s.match(/\[object (.*?)\]/)[1].toLowerCase();
}

type({}); // "object"
type([]); // "array"
type(5); // "number"
type(null); // "null"
type(); // "undefined"
type(/abcd/); // "regex"
type(new Date()); // "date"
```

So this must be problem solved, right? Sadly not quite yet. There are still a few instances where this method will return values other than we would expect.

```js
type(NaN); // "number"
type(document.body); // "htmlbodyelement"
```

Both of these cases return values that we probably wouldn't expect. In the case of `NaN` it returns `"number"` because technically `NaN` is a type of number, although in nearly all cases we want to know if something is a number, not **NOT** a number. The internal class used to implement the `<body>` element is `HTMLBodyElement` (at least in Chrome and Firefox) and there are specific classes for every element. In most cases we would just want to know if something is an element or not, if we then cared about the tag name of that element we can use the `tagName` property to retrieve it. However we can modify our existing method to handle these cases.

```js
var type = function (o) {

    // handle null in old IE
    if (o === null) {
        return 'null';
    }

    // handle DOM elements
    if (o && (o.nodeType === 1 || o.nodeType === 9)) {
        return 'element';
    }

    var s = Object.prototype.toString.call(o);
    var type = s.match(/\[object (.*?)\]/)[1].toLowerCase();

    // handle NaN and Infinity
    if (type === 'number') {
        if (isNaN(o)) {
            return 'nan';
        }
        if (!isFinite(o)) {
            return 'infinity';
        }
    }

    return type;
}
```

So now we have a method that will return the correct type for all the things we are interested in we can improve the original example to ensure that we don't have any `TypeError`'s.

```js
Api.get('/conversations', function (conversations) {

    // anyone reading this now knows
    // that conversations should be an array
    if (type(conversations) !== 'array') {
        App.renderMessages([]);
        return;
    }

    var intros = conversations.map(function (c) {

        if (type(c) !== 'object') {
            return '';
        }

        var name = type(c.theirName) === 'string' ? c.theirName : '';
        var mostRecent = '';

        if (type(c.messages) === 'array' &&
            type(c.messages[0]) === 'object' &&
            type(c.messages[0].text) === 'string') {
            mostRecent = c.messages[0].text.substring(0, 30);
        }

        return name + ': ' + mostRecent;
    });

    // much more likely to make it here now
    App.renderMessages(intros);
});
```

Obviously there is no getting away from the fact that we have had to add quite a lot of additional code to avoid the risk of `TypeError`'s, but at Badoo we would always rather send a few extra bytes of JavaScript down the wire if it means our application is more stable.

Finally, the rather obvious downside of the `type` method is that it requires checking the return value against a string every time. This is easily improved though. We can create an API similar to Underscore / LoDash / jQuery by doing the following:

```js
['Null',
 'Undefined',
 'Object',
 'Array',
 'String',
 'Number',
 'Boolean',
 'Function',
 'RegExp',
 'Element',
 'NaN',
 'Infinite'
].forEach(function (t) {
    type['is' + t] = function (o) {
        return type(o) === t.toLowerCase();
    };
});

// examples:
type.isObject({}); // true
type.isNumber(NaN); // false
type.isElement(document.createElement('div')); // true
type.isRegExp(/abc/); // true
```

This is the approach we take to type checking in JavaScript in our mobile web application and we have found it makes code easier to read and less likely to fail. The code for the `type` method explained in this post is available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jonbretman/7259628).
