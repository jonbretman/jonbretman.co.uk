I am a web developer working at [Lyst](http://www.lyst.com).

I used to play guitar in a band called The Foxes, and had some great times travelling around the world playing shows to 2 or 3 people who probably thought we weren't too bad. We eventually released an <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Foxes/Last+of+Many">album</a> but 5 years of being successfully ignored by the music industry I decided to make a career switch to tinkering with code.

I have given talks about JavaScript at JSConfEU in Berlin and Yet Another Conference in Moscow. The slides for both
of these talks are on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jonbretman">SpeakerDeck</a> and there is a video of my Yet Another Conference talk <a href="http://tech.yandex.ru/events/yac/2013/talks/1116/">here</a>.
