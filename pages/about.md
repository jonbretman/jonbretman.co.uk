I used to play guitar in a band called The Foxes, and had some great times travelling around the world playing shows to 2 or 3 people who probably thought we weren't too bad. We eventually released an [album](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Foxes/Last+of+Many) but 5 years of being successfully ignored by the music industry I decided to make a career switch to tinkering with code.

I am currently the Lead Frontend Engineer at [Lyst](http://www.lyst.com/), a really awesome company based in Shoreditch full of interesting and talented people. I have given talks about JavaScript at JSConfEU in Berlin and Yet Another Conference in Moscow. The slides for both
of these talks are on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jonbretman) and there is a video of my Yet Another Conference talk [here](http://tech.yandex.ru/events/yac/2013/talks/1116/).
