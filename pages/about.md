I am a web developer working at [Lyst](http://www.lyst.com).

I used to play guitar in a band called The Foxes, and had some great times travelling around the world playing shows to 2 or 3 people who probably thought we weren't too bad. We eventually released an <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Foxes/Last+of+Many">album</a> but after 5 good years but sadly very little success I decided to make a career switch and become a web developer. I started by teaching myself some HTML and CSS, then PHP and MySQL, and eventually JavaScript. I enrolled on a part time Computer Science BSc at the University of London and started looking for jobs. My first proper web developer job was at <a href="http://www.mippin.com/web/">Mippin</a> and after 18 months I decided to move on to my current role at Badoo.

I have given talks about JavaScript at JSConfEU in Berlin and Yet Another Conference in Moscow. The slides for both of these talks are on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jonbretman">SpeakerDeck</a> and there is a video of my Yet Another Conference talk <a href="http://tech.yandex.ru/events/yac/2013/talks/1116/">here</a>
